HOW TO USE:
	guitest have two cmd tools: input_event_record and input_event_player.
	./input_event_record [a310|a1|a810]
	./input_event_player [a310|a1|a810] [filename]

	input_event_record is used to record the input_event, the event data will be stored in a file named by current time in current directory.
	input_event_player can play the input_event stored in file.

HOW TO PORTing to your machine:
	you need to add some argument in dev_val.h. 

NOTICE: you can choose the input_event according to [cat /proc/bus/input/devices], bue do not record g_sensor event.(in my a1 machine is /dev/input/event1)
