the purpose of the this project:
I running a lot of service in my desktop environment at the company LAN, but the 
ip address was allway alterate, so my initial intent to develop this app is to let
my follow colleagues to detect my desktop's ip address much quickly.

this solution is to running a http server in my desktop, and the client must post reqest 
at least with a key/value pair: req=get_ip. Then a client scan all the LAN ip address with
that request, my computer will response with {'status' : 0, 'ret':ip_address}.

Next target: add some certification or encryption methods to eject the fake server.

sdp_server.py: a tornado server can handle post request and return the server's ip address.
get_server_ip.py: a single thread client whose's function is to request the ip address.
get_server_ip_thread.py: a multi thread client can request the remote server's ip address much faster.
